/*
  "rate limiter" middleware

  All endpoints are rate limited to 10 requests per IP address per 60 seconds.
  If the limit is reached, any subsequent requests will return a 429 ("too many requests") error.  

  the signin user endpoint is rate limited to 3 requests per email. 
  If the limit is reached, the account status will be changed to "locked" and cannot be unlocked
  until the user has re-verified their email and changed their password.
